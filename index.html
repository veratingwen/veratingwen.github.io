        <em>A product & service design for home rehabilitation</em>
        <h2>Recovery</h2>
        <p>
            The project has designed a set of rehabilitation services and product designs for patients with lower limb
            hemiplegia based on the physical and psychological characteristics of the elderly and the problems that have
            been attributed to them. In collaboration with the local community, the product was positively evaluated by
            the five elderly people who tested it, positively contributing to lower limb rehabilitation issues.

        <p>
            MagicSound, a music and entertainment company based in the UK, faced challenges with its website's
            information architecture, potentially resulting in a less-than-ideal user experience. This project aims to
            enhance and revamp the website to optimise both its user experience and visual design.

        <h4>Project name: Self-reflection</h4>
        <p>
            The user responds to questions on the device with facial expressions, and the interactive device recognises
            the user's facial expressions. Different reactions can have different effects on a child's stage of
            development. The hope is that the device will provoke adults to think - any behaviour can be magnified in
            the eyes of a child, and these behaviours can affect the child's future development.

            Drifting bottle is a symbol of cross-cultural communication of human beings in the age of seafaring,
            nowadays flying is one of the ways we travel around the world, but waiting for a plane is sometimes a long
            and boring thing. If we can use this time to play a short game that can help people pass the boredom and
            convey cross-cultural communication, I think it's a meaningful thing.
